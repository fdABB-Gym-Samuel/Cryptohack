# Formally, "calculating time" is described by the theory of congruences. We say that two integers are congruent modulo m if a ≡ b mod m.

# Another way of saying this, is that when we divide the integer a by m, the remainder is b. This tells you that if m divides a (this can be written as m∣a) then a ≡ 0 mod m.


# 11 ≡ x mod 6
# 8146798528947 ≡ y mod 17

x = 11 % 6
y = 8146798528947 % 17

print(f"({x}, {y})")
